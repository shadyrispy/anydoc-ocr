//! Constants used throughout the OCR pipeline.

//! parameters, batch sizes, and tensor size limits.

/// The default maximum width for images in the OCR pipeline.

/// Matches the official PaddleOCR DBNet default of 960 (was previously 736).

/// The default shape (channels, height, width) for recognition images.
